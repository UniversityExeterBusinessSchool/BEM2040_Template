# BEM2040_Template
This is a template repository for the BEM2040 Database Technologies for Business Analysts module.

## Folders
There are three folders in this repository.  
1.  Models
    This folder should contain your ERD and normalisation files.

2.  Python Files
    This folder should contain all python files that will demonstrate the business logic for your database project.

3.  SQL Files
    This folder should contain a backup of your database.  These are expected to be the DDL files that can be exported from your database as "Script As Create".  Ensure you include all tables, views, stored procedures and triggers.
